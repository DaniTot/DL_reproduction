1.
When using ResNet101 to extract features out of the ImageNet database we can split this up in 2 parts: High and Low.
For High-level features we use te complete ResNet structure to extract these. But for Low we need to only take the
structure till conv4_3. And this notation is unclear to us when comparing this to the resnet summary.

2.
What are the feature embedding functions?

3.
What does spatial-temporal relation

4.
When talking about sampling locations p_n, do you mean individual pixels, or box of pixels?

5.
If sampling locations p_n are boxes of pixels, then can they overlap?

6.
What is the ILSVRC2015 DET dataset, and where can I find it?
