When using ResNet101 to extract features out of the ImageNet database we can split this up in 2 parts: High and Low.
For High-level features we use te complete ResNet structure to extract these. But for Low we need to only take the
structure till conv4_3. And this notation is unclear to us when comparing this to the resnet summary.
