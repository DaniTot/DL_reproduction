# Reproduction project on "Learning Where to Focus for Efficient Video Object Detection" by Jiang et al.


# Introduction 

Just a short introduction about the project and the paper.

- Motivation and scope
- No generic first sentence
- 3 contributions
- figure 1 (visual abstract of the paper)
- Few research

# Original research paper

Discussing the goal of the original paper.

# Dataset used

ImageVID/ImageNET
- What is the dataset made off?
    - Classes
    - Annotations
- Where is it originated from
- Benefits of the dataset


# Machine learning model used.

ResNet101
- goal of ResNET
- pretrained model
- till layer 50 for low level features
    - implement image for layer selection
- complete for high level features

# Own implementation

# The machine learning reproducibility checklist

for all models and algorithms presented, check that you include: 
- A clear description of the mathematical setting, algorithm, and/or model.
- An analysis of the complexity (time, space, sample size) of any algorithm.
- A link to a downloadable source code with specification of all dependencies, including external libraries.

for any theoretical claim, check that you include:
- A statement of the result
- A clear explanation of each assumption
- A complete proof of the claim

for all figures and tables that present empirical results, check that you include:
- A complete description of the data collection process, including sample size.
- A link to a downloadable version of the data set or simulation environment.
- An explanation of any data that was excluded and a description of any preprocessing step.
- An explanation of how samples were allocated for training, validation, and testing.
- The range of hyperparameters considered, method to select the best hyperparameter configuration, and specification of each hyperparameter used to generate results.
- The exact number of evaluations runs.
- A description of how experiments were run.
- A clear definition of the specific measure or statistics used to report results.
- Clearly defined error bars. 
- A description of results with central tendency (e.g., mean) and variation (e.g., stddev).
- A description of the computing infrastructure used.
